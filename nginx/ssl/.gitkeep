# SSL certificates directory
# Place your SSL certificates here:
# - fullchain.pem (certificate chain)
# - privkey.pem (private key)
#
# For development, generate self-signed certificates:
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
#   -keyout privkey.pem -out fullchain.pem \
#   -subj "/CN=localhost"
#
# For production, use Let's Encrypt or a trusted CA
